# ðŸŒ¿ Plant Disease Prediction using Deep Learning

This project aims to detect and classify plant diseases from leaf images using deep learning. It uses a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) model trained on labeled plant disease images. A simple and interactive local web interface is built using **Streamlit** to allow users to upload leaf images and view disease predictions.

Early and accurate detection of plant diseases is crucial in agriculture to ensure healthy crop yields and reduce losses. This project automates that detection process using computer vision and deep learning, eliminating the need for manual inspection. The system supports multiple disease classes and can predict the disease category from an uploaded leaf image with high accuracy.

The user interface is implemented using Streamlit, allowing users to interact with the model locally. Users can upload an image of a plant leaf, and the app processes it using the trained CNN model to display the predicted disease. This tool is intended to assist farmers, researchers, and agricultural professionals in diagnosing plant health quickly and efficiently.
