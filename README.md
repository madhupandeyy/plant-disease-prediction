# ðŸŒ¿ Plant Disease Prediction using Deep Learning

This project aims to detect and classify plant diseases from leaf images using deep learning. It uses a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) model trained on labeled plant disease images. The final solution is deployed using Streamlit to make the model accessible via a user-friendly web interface.
